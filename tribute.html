      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Martin Luther King:</h3>
      <li><strong>1929</strong> - Born in Atlanta, Georgia.</li>
      <li><strong>1948</strong> - King graduated at the age of 19 from Morehouse with a B.A. in sociology.
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - A fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case.</li>
      <li><strong>1963</strong> - The SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. King was arrested in 1963 for protesting the treatment of blacks in Birmingham.</li>
      <li><strong>1963</strong> - King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the "Big Six" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. He delivered a 17-minute speech, later known as "I Have a Dream".</li>
      <li><strong>1965</strong> - Broody Sunday was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.</li>
      <li><strong>1966</strong> - After several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North, with Chicago as their first destination. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S. Hamlin Avenue, in the slums of North Lawndale on Chicago's West Side, as an educational experience and to demonstrate their support and empathy for the poor.</li>
      <li><strong>1967</strong> - Opposition to the Vietnam War. Exactly one year before his deathâ€”King delivered a speech titled "Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence." He spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, arguing that the U.S. was in Vietnam "to occupy it as an American colony" and calling the U.S. government "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.</li>
      <li><strong>1968</strong> - King and the SCLC organized the "Poor People's Campaign" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an "economic bill of rights" for poor Americans.</li>
      <li><strong>1968</strong> - King was killed at 39 years old in Memphis, Tennessee. He was there to support the black sanitary public works employees. </li>
